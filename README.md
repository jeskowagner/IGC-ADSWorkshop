# Applied Data Science Workshop at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer
This workshop series aims to unite computational researchers at IGC to solve
Data Science, modelling and AI challenges.
The workshop series is open for everyone - students, staff, postdocs, and PIs.
If you would like to get exposure to Data Science and AI model building, just come along!

## Aims
The aims of this workshop series are to
- Connect the computational community at IGC
- Develop transferable skills in data preprocessing, visualisation, and model building
- Get hands-on experience with solving AI problems

## Challenges
The challenges we tackle should have a biological background and narrow scope.
We will present some possible challenges during the first workshop on the
14th of April and you get to choose what to tackle!

Sources for challenges may be [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [DREAM](https://dreamchallenges.org/),
or any other source that our community would benefit from. 

Simple challenges may deviate from the overall bio-theme to keep them short and approachable, for example the [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

Examples for more advanced challenges are: [cell image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recursion-cellular-image-classification) and [MOA prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lish-moa/overview.)
If you find any good source please let us [know](##Feedback)!

## Format
At the start of the first workshop, Jesko will present the idea behind this workshop series.
At all workshops, including the first one, some challenges will be presented and we will jointly tackle one of them after a vote. That means that we will break into groups and either compete on the same problem or each group tackles a part of the problem, depending on its scope. During the first workshop, the challenge will be clearly defined and small in scope.

## Preparation
No preparation is needed and computers will be available. Feel free to bring your own laptop though! While we encourage all learners to join, some prior expertise in usage of command line, git, and programming will be beneficial, because we do not formally teach these during the workshop. Rather, we will develop solutions in groups 

## Feedback
We are very eager to tailor these workshops to your needs.
Have a specific challenge in mind, or a skill you would like to develop?
Let us know! We are happy to adjust the content accordingly.
