# May Competition
Thank you for participating in this month's challenge!

This challenge will aim to predict whether a person exercises from other information about the person.

Disclaimer: this data is simulated and not realistic. Most of the simulated data weights have
been generated by ChatGPT and may reflect bias in the training data.
We neither agree with nor endorse the views expressed in the data.
It is supposed to served as a somewhat realistic example but should not be used to inform 
any world views.
Similarly, the data may not be based on real world expectations and may not be realistic, so rely only
on your model building knowledge to solve it.

That said, here are the columns we are using to predict whether a person does exercise:
- exercise (binary)
- age (continuous)
- gender (binary) [Note: this is of course not an accurate representation of gender and only used to simplify the representation of the data]
- income (continuous, no scale)
- education (continuous, no scale)
- health (continuous, no scale)
- happiness (continuous, no scale)
- smoking (binary)
- diet (binary)
- weight (continuous, no scale)
